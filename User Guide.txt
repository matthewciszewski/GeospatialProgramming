User Guide
This user guide is aimed at intermediate level QGIS operators and users with some knowledge of python scripting. This user guide works best if QGIS is open to a new project and the available sample data stored in a raw data directory and an empty analysis directory at the same hierarchy level for example:
D:\YourFolder\Rawdata
D:\YourFolder\Analysis
1.	In QGIS open the processing toolbox and select create a new script from the   drop down menu
2.	Open Python script from https://github.com/matthewciszewski/GeospatialProgramming/blob/main/VPCPSLOITool.py
3.	Copy and paste the script into the new script dialog box and save the script.
4.	Run the Script. The Dialog in Graphic 6 appears.
5.	Use Graphic 6 as an example for the tool data requirements and select the sample data as provided.
6.	Run the tool.
7.	Tool data requires same attributes and data types as sample data provided.
8.	All the analysis data created will be stored to D:\YourFolder\Analysis.
9.	The final analysis outputs will be stored to D:\YourFolder.
